Dodecahedral puzzle

Basically the Rubik's Cube idea applied to a dodecahedron. This is the third version of this program that I've written. The first was in GLUT in C, the second with SDL in C++ and this version is C# with XNA/MonoGame. The first version was a proof of concept to see if this kind of puzzle could be done. The second version was to help visualize how the pieces would fit together so that I could build a physical version. That project got scrapped after I found out that there's a company that manufactures these under the name Megaminx. This version was written as a introduction to MonoGame and then ported to XNA to see how closely the two APIs functioned. (Short answer: fairly closely, though the vertex format I used with MonoGame needed to be altered to display properly with XNA.)
